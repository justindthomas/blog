# Might need an adjustment

I think it might be time to add a sensitivity parameter to my network mapping code:

That's the result of me running an nmap scan on my internal network to track down the IP address of an old network switch that I recently connected (which I don't have the proper gendered serial connector to connect in to at the moment).

I suppose the upside is that it's easy to see when someone is scanning my network.
