# Obligatory Information

You're probably wondering what this is all about. Here are some questions you might be thinking. And some answers to those questions.

## Who are you?

My name is Justin Thomas. I work professionally as an information security team leader and technical architect. You can learn more about my career on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/justinthomas).

## Why does this blog exist?

I acquired this domain name in a fit of what I then considered to be self-cleverness (around the time when del.icio.us was a thing). It sat unused for a bit until I became interested in Diaspora and set up a pod under the name of ser.endipito.us. I worked with that network for a while and wrote some code to add client-side javascript encryption there. I ultimately decided that was a [bad idea](https://github.com/justindthomas/scrypto).

Following the departure of the founding team, I decided to refocus my efforts elsewhere. 

Since then, this domain name has just existed in my inventory at my registrar. I recently decided to tackle learning Haskell and to use this location as my medium in that effort.
