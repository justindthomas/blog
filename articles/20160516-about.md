# Obligatory Information

You're probably wondering what this is all about. Here are some questions you might be thinking. And some answers to those questions.

## Who are you?

My name is Justin Thomas. I work professionally as an information security team leader and technical architect. You can learn more about my career on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/justinthomas).

## Why does this blog exist?

I acquired this domain name in a fit of what I then considered to be self-cleverness (around the time when del.icio.us was a thing). It sat unused for a bit until I became interested in Diaspora and set up a pod under the name of ser.endipito.us. I worked with that network for a while and wrote some code to add client-side javascript encryption there. I ultimately decided that was a [bad idea](https://github.com/justindthomas/scrypto).

Following the departure of the founding team and after I became weary of the constant political infighting that had become almost ubiquitous in Diaspora interactions, I decided to refocus my efforts elsewhere. 

Since then, this domain name has just existed in my inventory at my registrar. I recently decided to tackle learning Haskell and to use this location as my medium in that effort.

## Why am I here?

I can't answer that question. Why do any of us make the choices that we make? You might start [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_imperative).

# Ways to Contact Me

My personal brand (Lord save me for using that term) is terribly fragmented. I'd love it if "jdt" were available everywhere, but I was just too slow.

It is what it is. In addition to the links below, you can often find me lurking on Freenode as "jdt".
