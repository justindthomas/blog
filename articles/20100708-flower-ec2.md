# Flower EC2 AMI Available

Here is a current shot of the Flower console:

I've made an EC2 AMI of the Analysis Server available on Amazon's AWS. If you'd like to try the system out and already have EC2 configured, follow these instructions:

* Configure a security group that allows ports 22/tcp, 8080/tcp, and 9995/udp
* Create an EC2 instance of `ami-3857bf51`; the command I use is (my security group is called "appserver"):
  
~~~~ {.bash}
ec2-run-instances -g appserver ami-3857bf51
~~~~
  
* Once loaded, log in via SSH and start the Flower server (all passwords are set to "flower" by default):

~~~~ {.bash}
asadmin start-domain flower
~~~~

* Use http://app.jdthomas.net to log in to your server; in the server field, enter "http://[EC2 IP Address]:8080" and both the username and password are "flower" â€“ just hit [Enter] on any field to submit the form (there is no button)

Of course, app.jdthomas.net will need access to your EC2 system on port 8080/tcp (it uses JAX-WS to access and present your data to you), so if you lock things down be sure to account for that. HTTPS works, but you'll need to configure and use a valid certificate on your EC2 system.

You can now configure your NetFlow exporters to send to the IP address of your EC2 instance on UDP port 9995 (version 9 only). I use softflowd on a couple of Debian systems with this command:

~~~~ {.bash}
softflowd -i eth0 -n [EC2 IP Address]:9995 -p /var/run/sfd.pid.ec2 -c /var/run/sfd.ctl.ec2 -v 9
~~~~

Configure your server using the "Manage" menu in the web application. Be sure to add networks (use CIDR addressing like 192.168.1.0/24) and users. Specified networks are required for the map, but area charts and flow tables will work without any networks specified.

E-mail me at justin@jdthomas.net with any questions! There are lots and lots of bugs and missing features, but I'll get to them over the coming months.

UPDATE: I made a few changes tonight to improve the Visualization server configuration; the URL is now http://app.jdthomas.net (this will redirect you to an SSL site of the same base but with a longer path). I've made that change in the text above as well.
